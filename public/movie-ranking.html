<h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Come and See</h3>

<p>Beautifully shot and appropriately terrifying, a war film that plays out more like a horror film.
</p>

<h3>Ikiru</h3>

<p>My favorite Kurosawa, very humanistic and a meditation on the meaning of life, from a man at the end of his.
</p>

<h3>Stalker</h3>

<p>Meditative and beautifully shot, an philosophical examination of life between three characters, named Stalker, Writer, and Professor
